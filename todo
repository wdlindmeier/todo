TODO:
Scriptaculous isnt needed. Change transition.
Always show tags
Sorting list doesnt take into account a long li?
New tags get random color
New items should get position at the end of the list (autoincrement?)
tag order should be name, not id
dragging li's positions should take the sort order into account (ASC or DESC)
Clicking to reorder the items is a little annoying... although, an apple standard
cache manifest that bitch!
