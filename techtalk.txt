Client Side Storage in HTML5
=================================

Overview:

LocalStorage key/value pairs
	Very similar to cookies
	(e.g. sort order)
	Specific to domain, not DB
	
Cache Manifest
	Offline apps
	
SQLite DB
	JS ORM 
		Creates objects that can be saved to DB
		Queries DB and instantiates objects
		Manages relationships with other objects
	Show Schema
	Show sample data

Demo:

Todo List:
	• Add entries
	• Delete entries
	• Toggle entry completion
	• Reorder entries
	
Downfalls:
	• Data is less portable. Usually confined to 1 browser. Makes sense for mobile devices.

TODO:
Get notes from RGA computer
Whats the difference between localstorage and cookies?
How do we clear cache manifest?
How do we version DB schemas
Does cache manifest observe directories or wildcards?
